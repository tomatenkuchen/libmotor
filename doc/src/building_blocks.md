# Building Blocks

Libraries are all about basic blocks to build bigger things with. This library
contains some of the blocks I found useful when working with motors. Make sure
you understand what they do, before you work with them.

Most of their API - hopefully - is well documented by reading the code
documentation. Non the less here come some concepts that don't fit so well
in this comment section.

- dq-ab-abc transformations
- hall sensors
- PID  controller
- PT1 filter
- PLLs
